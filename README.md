# Overview

{Provide a description the game that you wrote. Describe how to play your game.}

I wrote this program to learn how to manipulate images, sounds, and mouse inputs.
I also wanted to learn how to really use classes and objects in a way that had
meaning and tested my ability to manipulate a base class without affecting the
class entirely.
